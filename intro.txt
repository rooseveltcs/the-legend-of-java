We haven't much time so listen up. 
My name is DrawingPanel@41cf53f9.
But you can call me DP for short.
I am, what the programmers of this world call an OOP.
I have been dormant for many many years.
I have been hidden away from prying eyes. 
It is imperative that I do not fall into the wrong hands.
This is because I carry with me super...
duper... 
DUPER, valuable information; 
It pertains to a battle that commenced in a place very very far from here.
Embedded within in the information that I carry...
Is the knowledge of a mysterious tool in this world. 
A tool that was preserved by my masters after the great battle.
Few will be able to understand this.
Even fewer can use it.
Are you one of these few??
