This may be a surprise to you, but the Trinity War has been going on since the beginning mankind.
Before humans banded together according to race, religion etc, they were seperated by 3 major factions.
The Seez, The Fangs and The Javas.
Each faction was in constant competition with one another.
Before mankind had really evolved, they fought over basic things.
Land...
Food...
People...
But as time went on and humans progressed intellectually, they fought for greater things.
Glory...
Recognition...
Influence...
Since the birth of each factions, the leadership position has been passed down when one leader dies, unto the next.
That has kept each faction alive.
But like all things, time has distorted which faction is which, and so they have taken many names over the years.
In our this current age, these factions control major companies, and fight for influence.
Google, Microsoft and Amazon.
Target, Walmart and Costco.
These are but a few instances of the orignal factions battling one another.
Now the Trinity war has branched out into the computer science field.
The Seez hope to spread the C++ Programming Language around the world.
The Fangs work to push the programming language titled "Python".
My creators, the Java Overlords have programmed me to teach potential coding gods the basics of the Java Language.
We NEED your help, and thankfully, you've decided to give it.
